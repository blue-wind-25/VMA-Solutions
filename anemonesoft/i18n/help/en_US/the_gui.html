<h1><center>Basics of the Graphical User Interface</center></h1>

<p>Upon starting the application, one will be presented with the application splash-screen.
After approximately three seconds, the splash-screen will disappear and the main application
window will be displayed.</p>

<h2><a name='main_window'>The Main Application Window</a></h2>
<p>An empty application main window is shown below. Please note that the actual appearance
of the window may differ slightly between platforms and operating systems.</p>

    <img src='images/app_main_window.png' width='360' height='270'/>
</a></center>
<center class='small'>(click image to enlarge)</center>

<p>Basically, the window can be divided into four major sections, from top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The window-title area;</li>
    <li>The menu area;</li>
    <li>The toolbar area; and</li>
    <li>The working area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The window-title area belongs to the operating system. The menu area contains all the commands
that can be used to perform tasks, such as creating a new project, opening an existing project,
saving the current project, creating plot, performing analysis, and so on. The toolbar are contains
short-cuts to some of the most commonly used commands. Finally, the working are is the area in
which one will be able to enter and process data. By default, upon application start, the working
area will only contain the <b>Data Input</b> tab (the spreadsheet).</p>

<h3><a name='menu_area'>The Menu Area</a></h3>
<p>The <b>File</b> menu contains commands that are mostly related to project management. The contents
of the menu are shown below:</p>
<center><img src='images/mnu_file.png'/></center>
<p>The <b>Spreadsheet</b> menu contains commands for manipulating the spreadsheet. The contents of the
menu are shown below:</p>
<center><img src='images/mnu_spreadsheet.png'/></center>
<p>The <b>Plot</b> menu contains commands for creating plots. The contents of the menu are shown below:</p>
<center><img src='images/mnu_plot.png'/></center>
<p>The <b>Analysis</b> menu and sub-menu contain commands for performing analysis. The contents of the
menu and sub-menu are shown below:</p>
<center><table cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr valign='bottom'>
    <td><img src='images/mnu_analysis.png'/></td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src='images/mnu_analysis_linearity.png'/></td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src='images/mnu_analysis_precision.png'/></td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src='images/mnu_analysis_ap.png'/></td>
</tr></table></center>
<p>The <b>Toolbox</b> menu contains some useful utilities. The contents of the menu are shown below:</p>
<center><img src='images/mnu_toolbox.png'/></center>
<p>Finally, the <b>Help</b> menu contains commands to obtains information about the application.
The contents of the menu are shown below:</p>
<center><img src='images/mnu_help.png'/></center>

<h3><a name='toolbar_area'>The Toolbar Area</a></h3>
<p>The toolbar area can be divided into three sections, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The left-button area;</li>
    <li>The middle-information area; and</li>
    <li>The right-button area.</li>
</ul>
<p>The left-button area contains buttons that act as short-cuts to some of the commands in the <b>File</b> menu.
The middle-information area displays the path of the currently open project. The right-button area contains buttons
that act as short-cuts to the commands in the <b>Spreadsheet</b> menu. The pictures below show the function of the
toolbar's buttons.</p>
<center><table cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr valign='bottom'>
    <td><img src='images/tlb_file.png'/></td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td><img src='images/tlb_spreadsheet.png'/></td>
</tr></table></center>

<h2><a name='tab_data_input'>The Data Input Tab</a></h2>
<p>The data-input tab is the only tab that cannot be closed. One can use the spreadsheet in this tab to enter data.
Simply click any cell to start entering data. Pressing <b>Enter</b> will move the cursor to the next row. One can also
use arrows to navigate the cells. Press <b>F2</b> to edit the content of the active cell. The cells only accepts
numeric values (numbers).</p>
<center><a href='#images/tab_data_input.png'>
    <img src='images/tab_data_input.png' width='354' height='226'/>
</a></center>
<center class='small'>(click image to enlarge)</center>
<p>Click on a cell and drag the mouse pointer to select cells. One can also select cells by holding the <b>Shift</b>
key while pressing the arrows. The selected cells can be cut, copied, and cleared by using the commands from the
<b>Spreadsheet</b> menu, the buttons from the toolbar, or the keyboard short-cuts. Please have a look at the commands
in the <b>Spreadsheet</b> menu for the keyboard short-cuts associated with the commands.</p>
<p>One may enter both data (numbers) and comments in the cells. All non-number entries are assumed as comments.
If comments are included in the input data range, they will be evaluated as if they were zeroes. If all cells in the
first row (from all the selected rows) contain only comments, the row will be assumed as a header row.</p>
<p>One can double-click the data input tab to change its caption.</p>

<!-- ### -->
<h2><a name='tab_plot'>The Plot Tab</a></h2>
<p>The plot tab is the tab where plots are generated and displayed. Basically, the tab can be divided into three
major sections:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The setting-accordion section (the left part of the tab);</li>
    <li>The caption-setting section (the bottom-right part of the tab); and</li>
    <li>The plot-display section (the top-right-part of the tab).</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of each section may differ between plot types. The picture below depicts the appearance of
a <b>box-whisker</b> plot tab:</p>
<center><a href='#images/tab_plot.png'>
    <img src='images/tab_plot.png' width='354' height='226'/>
</a></center>
<center class='small'>(click image to enlarge)</center>
<p>One can use the setting-accordion section to specify the data range, data point (plot) style, axis scale, and
some other settings. One can use the caption-setting section to set the plot captions. Finally, one can use the
plot-display section to update the plot, zoom the plot in an external window, print the plot, and save the plot
as image. Please note that changes in the settings will not be propagated to the plot until the update button is
pressed.</p>
<p>One can double-click the plot tab to change its caption.</p>

<h2><a name='tab_analysis'>The Analysis Tab</a></h2>

<p>The analysis tab is the tab where analysis are performed and results are displayed. Basically, the tab can be divided
into three major sections:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The setting-accordion section (the left part of the tab);</li>
    <li>The caption-setting section (the bottom-right part of the tab); and</li>
    <li>The result (plot and report) section (the top-right-part of the tab).</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of each section may differ between analysis types. The picture below depicts the appearance of
a <b>1<sup>st</sup>-order-regression</b> analysis tab:</p>
<center><a href='#images/tab_analysis.png'>
    <img src='images/tab_analysis.png' width='354' height='226'/>
</a></center>
<center class='small'>(click image to enlarge)</center>
<p>One can double-click the analysis tab to change its caption.</p>
<p>One can use the setting-accordion section to specify the analysis setting, data range, plot style, axis scale, and
some other settings. One can use the caption-setting section to set the plot captions. Finally, one can use the
result section to update the plot/report, zoom the plot in an external window, print the plot/report, and save the
plot/report to file. Just like the plot tab, changes in the settings will not be propagated to the plot/report until the
update button is pressed.</p>
<p>Unlike a plot tab, an analysis tab may display other results, in addition to the plot. Some analysis may even have
no plot to display. One can choose which results to be displayed by clicking the tabs on the result section. In the
case of the <b>1<sup>st</sup>-order-regression</b> tab, the available choices are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The regression-plot tab;</li>
    <li>The residual-plot tab;</li>
    <li>The report-text tab; and</li>
    <li>The content-calculation tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those choices correspond to the tabs shown below, from left to right.</p>
<center><img src='images/tab_analysis_tab.png'/></center>
