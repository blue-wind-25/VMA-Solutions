<h1><center>Default Data Layout for Analysis</center></h1>
<p>The input-data-range setting-panel connects the spreadsheet to the analysis system.
Despite the fact that one can manually enter the data range into the text boxes in the panel,
the application can automatically do this if one follows the default data layout for the
corresponding analysis. Simply block (select) the cells that contains the analysis data and
use the <b>Analysis</b> menu to start a new analysis. Please refer to the pictures below for
more details.</p>

<center><img src='images/oper_new_anal.png'/></center>
<p>The default data layout system is relative to the first selected cell (the top-left cell).
Therefore, there is no need to always start from cell <b>A1</b>.</p>

the second column as the Y-2 values, and disregard the remaining columns.
Please refer to the picture below for more details (the selection block is not shown so that

<p>Please note that one must put the lowest concentration values as Y-1 and the highest concentration
values as Y-2.</p>

<!-- ### -->
<h2><a name='precision'>Precision</a></h2>
<p>The precision analysis encompasses a simple RSD-based precision analysis and a 1-Way ANOVA analysis.</p>

<!-- ### -->
<h3><a name='prsd'>RSD</a></h3>
<p>Relative to the first selected cell, the application will take the first column as the X values
and disregard the other columns.
Please refer to the picture below for more details (the selection block is not shown so that

<h3><a name='powana'>1-Way ANOVA</a></h3>
<p>Relative to the first selected cell, the application will take the first column as the X-1 values,
the second column as the X-2 values, the third column as the X-3 values, and so on.
Please refer to the picture below for more details (the selection block is not shown so that
the picture can be seen more clearly). One can safely ignore the <i>Measurement True Value</i> setting panel
if one is not going to use the result of this robustness analysis in accuracy profile analysis.</p></p>

<!-- ### -->
<h2><a name='accuracy'>Accuracy</a></h2>
<p>Relative to the first selected cell, the application will take the first column as the
Xc values, the second column as the Xf-1 values, the third column as the Xf-2 values, and so on.
Please refer to the picture below for more details (the selection block is not shown so that
the picture can be seen more clearly).</p>

<!-- ### -->
<h2><a name='robustness'>Robustness</a></h2>
<p>Relative to the first selected cell, the application will take the first column as the
response values, the second column as the 1st-factor values, the third column as the 2nd-factor values,
and so on. Please refer to the picture below for more details (the selection block is not shown so that
the picture can be seen more clearly). One can safely ignore the <i>Measurement &#948;real</i> setting panel
if one is not going to use the result of this robustness analysis in accuracy profile analysis.</p>

<p>The application provides a mechanism to generate the template for Plackett-Burmann Design. Simply
select <b>Template for Plackett-Burmann Design</b> in the <b>Spreadsheet</b> menu to start generating
the template. A dialog will be shown. Select the number of factors and press OK. Please note that the
actual appearance of the dialog box may differ slightly between platforms and operating systems.</p>
<center><img src='images/dlg_gen_pbd_template.png'/></center>
<p>The application will then generate the template</p>
<center><img src='images/ddl_anal_robustness_0.png'/></center>
<p>Fill-in the response value in the first column (by default they all 0.0). Fill-in the factor values
in the second, third, and so on columns (by default they all either -1.0 or +1.0). The -1.0 values are
to be replaced with the minimum concentration/level/etc. of the factors, the +1.0 values are to be
replaced with the maximum concentration/level/etc. of the factors.</p>
<p>The template defines the minimum number of data that must be entered in order for the analysis can be
carried out. However, one is free to add more data to the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2><a name='aprofile'>Accuracy Profile</a></h2>
<p>The accuracy profile analysis encompasses the Gonz&#225;les <i>et al.</i> and Rozet <i>et al.</i> methods.</p>

<!-- ### -->
<h3><a name='apgonza'>Gonz&#225;les <i>et al.</i> Method</a></h3>
<p>One must perform some precision analyses (via 1-way ANOVA) and, optionally, the same number of
robustness analyses. One must fill-in the <i>Measurement True Value</i> setting panels from within the precision
(1-way ANOVA) analysis tabs. If any robustness analysis was also used, one must also fill-in the <i>Measurement &#948;real</i>
setting panels from within the robustness analysis tabs. Only maximum 7 factors can be used in any of the
robustness analyses.</p>
<p>Currently, the results from all precision and robustness analysis tabs will be used as the inputs of the
accuracy profile analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to put the accuracy profile analysis as the last tab.
If robustness analysis is used, the the first robustness analysis will be associated with the first precision
analysis, the second with the second, and so on. Hence, the order of the tabs matter.</p>

<h3><a name='aprozet'>Rozet <i>et al.</i> Method</a></h3>
<p>One must perform some precision analyses (via 1-way ANOVA).One must fill-in the <i>Measurement True Value</i>
setting panels from within the precision (1-way ANOVA) analysis tabs.</p>
