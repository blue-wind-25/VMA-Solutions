<h1><center>Default Data Layout for Plot</center></h1>
<p>The input-data-range setting-panel connects the spreadsheet to the plot-drawing system.
Despite the fact that one can manually enter the data range into the text boxes in the panel,
the application can automatically do this if one follows the default data layout for the
corresponding plot. Simply block (select) the cells that contains the plot data and use the
<b>Plot</b> menu to create a new plot. Please refer to the pictures below for more details.</p>

<p>The default data layout system is relative to the first selected cell (the top-left cell).
Therefore, there is no need to always start from cell <b>A1</b>.</p>
