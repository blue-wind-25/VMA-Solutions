VMA Solutions (Validation Method of Analysis)

We have given this program freely for years. Now, we have decided to host it in GitHub in the hope that it will be accessible to a wider audience.


We offer several variation of licenses:

* If you would like to use only the **computational part** of this program and code to make your own library or application, you may use MIT, BSD, GNU LGPL, CC-BY, or other free software licenses that give attribution to us. In this case, we do not recommend you to use GNU GPL, CC-BY-SA, or other licenses that are too restrictive because it may limits the target audience.
* If you would like to fork the repository and create your own application that is still **largely** based on VMA (using both the GUI and computational part of the program and code), you may use MIT, BSD, GNU LGPL, GNU GPL, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, or other free software licenses that give attribution to us and guarantee that the final derived application will be freely redistributable.
* In case you would like to use other license you can discuss it with us.
